Simple improvements needed to the code:

1) Get the initial data-input GUI working.   User should be able to specify:
number of questions
rows per page
columns per page
whether to prompt for prefix PDF
whether to prompt for postfix PDF

1a) Clean up page/grid generation to implement arbitrary row/column choices.  
1b) Add question numbering.

2) Export a "grading spreadsheet" with the correct answers listed student-by-student. 
(Should be in some format that works well with scantron software.   Watch out for edge cases, multi-answer questions, etc.)

3) Auto-recognize dimensions of GIF and scale cropping to match.  

4) Make a little image-selection-box GUI so user can perform the cropping operation with a mouse.

5) Be more flexible about roster file format.

Slightly harder improvements:

6) Interface to question banks other than the image/screenshot files?   

7) Some sort of preview function?
